Project Definition:
	Sparky is a popular music service provider similar to Spotify and Pandora. The given customer's dataset is logs of customers behaviour such as basic information about each user as well as the specific action they have taken at that time.

	In this project, our goal is handling a customer churn problem by building predictive model on a small dataset (~125MB) of customer's activities on the service and attempt to predict customers who will churn based on their past behaviours.

Files:
	There are three data sets provided with the project:
	'Sparkify.ipynb:' : The main coding file in jypyter notebook format to work in Udacity workspace.
	'Sparkify.html' : an HTML file for the jupyter workbook.
	'README.md' : This file.
Instructions:
	The data is provided by Sparkify for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program. Please see the jupyter note book file for the detail analysis.
